    <h1>Water</h1>
<!--    Paragraph Tag-->
    <p>Water (chemical formula H2O) is an inorganic, transparent, tasteless, odorless, and nearly colorless chemical substance, which is the main constituent of Earth's hydrosphere and the fluids of all known living organisms (in which it acts as a solvent[1]). It is vital for all known forms of life, even though it provides no calories or organic nutrients. Its chemical formula H2O, indicates that each of its molecules contains one oxygen and two hydrogen atoms, connected by covalent bonds. The hydrogen atoms are attached to the oxygen atom at an angle of 104.45°.[2] "Water" is the name of the liquid state of H2O at standard conditions for temperature and pressure.</p>
    <h2>States</h2>
    <p>Along with oxidane, water is one of the two official names for the chemical compound H
2O;[12] it is also the liquid phase of H
2O.[13] The other two common states of matter of water are the solid phase, ice, and the gaseous phase, water vapor or steam. The addition or removal of heat can cause phase transitions: freezing (water to ice), melting (ice to water), vaporization (water to vapor), condensation (vapor to water), sublimation (ice to vapor) and deposition (vapor to ice).[14]</p>
    <h3>Density</h3>
    <p>Water differs from most liquids in that it becomes less dense as it freezes.[16] In 1 atm pressure, it reaches its maximum density of 1,000 kg/m3 (62.43 lb/cu ft) at 3.98 °C (39.16 °F).[17] The density of ice is 917 kg/m3 (57.25 lb/cu ft), an expansion of 9%.[18][19] This expansion can exert enormous pressure, bursting pipes and cracking rocks (see Frost weathering).[20]

In a lake or ocean, water at 4 °C (39.2 °F) sinks to the bottom, and ice forms on the surface, floating on the liquid water. This ice insulates the water below, preventing it from freezing solid. Without this protection, most aquatic organisms would perish during the winter.[21]</p></body></html>
